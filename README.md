# Automated Global Economic Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project is an **automated data ingestion, processing, and reporting system** built using **Google Apps Script, Google Drive API, and Google Sheets**. It automatically detects, converts, cleans, and consolidates uploaded Excel/Sheets files into a **centralized master dataset**. The project also provides **interactive economic dashboards** and Excel visualizations to deliver insights on key global indicators such as **inflation, GDP-PPP, misery index, and investments**.  

The solution reduces manual effort, improves data accuracy, and enables faster, data-driven decision-making.
